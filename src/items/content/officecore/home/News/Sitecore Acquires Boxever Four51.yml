        <p><span><strong>San Francisco, Mar. 3, 2021</strong></span>&nbsp;&mdash; Sitecore&reg;, the global leader in digital experience management software, today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements to acquire Boxever Ltd., a SaaS-based Customer Data Platform (CDP) providing decisioning and experimentation and Four51, Inc., a company delivering modern B2B and B2C experiences for enterprise brands. These acquisitions arrive following Sitecore&rsquo;s unveiling of a $1.2 billion investment plan to fund aggressive growth plans and product innovation earlier this year.</p>
        <p style="color: #3e4d5c; margin: 0px 0px 20px;">The pandemic has highlighted the need for a flexible and modern Digital Experience Platform (DXP) to provide organizations with the agility and intelligence to keep pace with changing demands. Integrating Boxever&rsquo;s and Four51&rsquo;s innovative technologies with Sitecore's digital marketing solutions will disrupt the industry by offering the first modern, integrated content-to-commerce, SaaS-based DXP. This solution will enable businesses to deliver real-time, personalized digital experiences across every aspect of the buying cycle, increasing customer value and loyalty.</p>
        <p>Boxever&rsquo;s CDP provides a 360-degree view of customers, advanced segmentation, real-time decisioning and experimentation that acts as the brain within an organization&rsquo;s marketing stack to make every customer interaction more relevant and engaging. The new capabilities expand and enhance Sitecore&rsquo;s customer intelligence and AI-driven personalization tools making it easy to capture, unify and activate customer data and deliver personalized experiences at scale.</p>
        <p>With Four51&rsquo;s API-first, headless e-commerce solution, enterprises can quickly and easily deliver engaging shopping experiences helping improve customer satisfaction, loyalty and advocacy. The platform complements Sitecore&rsquo;s existing B2C commerce capabilities and will enable Sitecore to define the digital experience market moving forward. Organizations of all sizes across industries will benefit from the expanded capabilities, need for less upfront investment, continuous innovation and a dramatically shorter time to value.</p>
        <p>The acquisitions are expected to close before the end of March, 2021 and financial terms are not being disclosed. On completion, both CEOs will take on leadership roles and Sitecore expects to invest and grow both Boxever's Dublin and Four51&rsquo;s Minneapolis headquarters.</p>
